# Week 3 Homework

## 1) Strategy Evaluation
- Compute $\delta$, NashConv and the exploitability of a strategy profile

## 2) (Naive) Fictitious Play
- Implement Fictitious Play in normal-form games
- Implement a **naive** version of Fictitious Play where you best-respond to the last strategy of the opponent, rather than the average one

## 3) Exploitability Convergence Plots
- Given a sequence of strategy profiles, plot the exploitability over time
