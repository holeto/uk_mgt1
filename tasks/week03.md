# Week 3 Homework

## 1) Strategy Evaluation
- Compute $\delta$ for both players
- Compute NashConv and exploitability of a given strategy profile
- Compute $\epsilon$ (as in $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium)

## 2) Nash <==> Maximin
Using the Minimax theorem, prove
- Nash => Maximin
- Maximin => Nash

## 3) Self-Play Methods
- Implement Fictitious Play for Normal-Form Games
- Implement a **naive** version of self-play where you best-respond against the last strategy of the opponent, rather than the average one
- Plot the exploitability of the average strategy profile for both implementations
