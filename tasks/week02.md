# Week 2 Homework

## 1) Best Response Value Function
- Plot the best-response value function for a 2xN matrix game.

## 2) Finding Nash Equilibria by Support Enumeration
- Given supports for both players, construct a set of linear equations and determine whether there exists a Nash Equilibrium for the given support. You can use Scipy to solve the constructed linear program.
- Implement the Support Enumeration algorithm which enumerates all possible supports and tries to find all Nash Equilibria for the given game.
