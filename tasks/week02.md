# Week 2 Homework

## 1) Best Response Value Function
- Plot the best response value function for a 2xN zero-sum game

## 2) Support Enumeration
- Given a pair of supports, construct a system of linear equations and check whether there exists a Nash equilibrium for those supports
- Implement the Support Enumeration algorithm which enumerates all possible pairs of supports to find all Nash equilibria in a normal-form game

## 3) Nash Equilibrium == Maximin Strategies in Zero-Sum Games
- Prove the two implications from the lecture slides
