# Week 6 Homework

## 1) Extensive-form Game Data Structure and Poker Games
- Implement a suitable data structure to represent extensive-form games
- Using the data structure, implement two-player version of Kuhn Poker
- Optionally, implement Leduc Poker, whose rules are described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.1411)

## 2) Strategy Evaluation
- Implement a function that computes the utility of both players for a given strategy profile
- Implement a function that computes the exploitability of a given strategy profile

## 3) Fictitious Play in Extensive-form Games
- Implement a function that properly averages a pair of strategies
- Implement a function that computes a best response to a given strategy of the opponent
- Implement the Fictitious Play algorithm by appropriately combining the functions above
- Finally, use the algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium in Kuhn Poker
