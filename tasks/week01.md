# Week 1 Homework

## 1) Dev Stack
- Get familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Get familiar with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib
- Get familiar with GitHub. You are expected to submit homework solutions to your **private** repository

## 2) Strategy Profile Evaluation
- Given mixed strategies of two players and two utility matrices, compute value for each player.
- Do the same, but for zero-sum games. This time, your function should only take a single matrix (as the other one is implied)

## 3) Best Response Calculation
- Given a mixed strategy of a player and a utility matrix, compute opponent's best responding strategy

## 4) Best Response Value Calculation
- Given a mixed strategy of a player and a utility matrix, compute agent's value when facing best-responding opponent.

## 5) Finding Dominated Actions
- Find dominated actions of both players when given their payoff matrices

## 6) Iterated Removal of Dominated Actions
- Implement the Iterated Removal of Dominated Actions algorithm
